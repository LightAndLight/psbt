# psbt
Build tool for PureScript written in Haskell

I made this because I'd rather not use Node.

Currently supports project initialisation, (naive) dependency management via bower, and project compilation.

## installation

psbt requires git (used to install dependencies)

It's not on stackage or hackage yet so just clone the repo and install:

```git clone https://github.com/LightAndLight/psbt.git && cd psbt && stack install```
